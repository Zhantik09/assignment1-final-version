Project Name
Morning at NYUAD



Project Description: 

The Morning at NYUAD video shows a perfect morning. In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, we rarely find time for our own pleasure. Our daily routine becomes quite boring and monotonous, long task lists and endless plans do not leave time for pleasant things. The video shows a beautiful morning on the NYUAD campus, where a person takes his/her time to grab favorite coffee and enjoy his/her morning routine. I wanted to create a beautiful mini film in bright colors, with calm music that will accompany the viewer during the viewing. There is nothing unusual in the film, just a morning and time spent with pleasure. To create a website for this film, I was inspired by the colors of one picture on the Internet, it was a dawn in purple tones. The website is simple, with three different pages each with their own content. The main page contains a description and the film itself, followed by pages with contacts and the process of work.




Process:

Film: First of all, we determined the theme, then we chose the locations and the main objects for shooting. On the go, we came up with different scenes and shooting angles. Next, we took and connected all the passages together and picked up nice music for the theme of the video.

Website: Initially, I realized for myself that this task is an opportunity for me to get acquainted with the basics of HTML and practice. To create a website, at the beginning I decided on a color palette (although I changed it a hundred times later). Next, using the wireframe as the framework for the website, I started writing the code: I created the pages, linked them together, created the NavigationBar and started editing all the elements. I customized colors, sizes, locations, and functions for the buttons. Next, I added a couple of new features for me and fixed bugs.




Reflection/Evaluation:

In fact, when I created the wireframe, it seemed to me that it would be easier. Since I had not worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript before, I initially got very confused in the most basic concepts. To some extent, I believe that I overestimated my knowledge and worked a lot with absolutely every little thing in the code for some time. I think that my site still has a lot of room to operate much better. Moreover, it seems to me that it is not as creative as I wanted to see it. However, I think that it was a very valuable experience and a good start to getting to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So in general my expectations were met, with a good experience and a chance for improvement next time. In the future, I plan to only improve my skills and not stop there.
