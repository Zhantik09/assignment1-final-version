<p class="process-creation2">To create a 30MFF film, my peer and I began to develop our idea.
To begin with, we discussed our general thoughts and chose one idea. Having decided to shoot our version of the perfect morning, we began to look for the main character of our mini-movie - it turned out to be coffee.

Then, we continued to delve into the details of the visual. We determined for ourselves under what lighting the shooting will take place, how the frames will change and what props we will need. <br>

<br>
We started shooting at different locations, preferably in places with bright colors around (for example, there were a lot of plants in the video, greenery in the background).
<br>
The process turned out to be very interesting and even fun, and the result is quite pleased with its overall picture.
